- 1 Ugin's Nexus	+ 1 Tormenting Voice // Extra turn cards should be put in with caution. They can be really dull to play against
- 1 Strata Scythe	+ 1 Wild Guess // I don't think the scythe is necessary. You're not a beat down deck.
- 1 Moltensteel Dragon	+ 1 Magmatic Insight // Underpowered card
- 1 Mimic Vat	+ 1 Slobad, Goblin Tinkerer // Mimic vat is a cool card but doesn't really fit the theme of the deck as it will be exiling your creatures rather than letting them go to the gyard.
- 1 Palladium Myr	+ 1 Karn, Silver Golem // Generally it's bad to rely on creatures to do your ramping. They're much more vulnerable.

Optional Stuff
- 1 Epochrasite	+ 1 Gauntlet of Might 
- 1 Tuktuk the Explorer	+ 1 Scuttling Doom Engine // Not sure what Tuktuk is really doing here. Am I missing some synergy?
- 1 Dualcaster Mage	+ 1 Hellkite Igniter // Hellkite Igniter can kill extremely fast in this deck. It's a lot of fun.
- 1 Loreseeker's Stone	+ 1 Gamble // Gamble is the shit. Loreseeker's Stone is just shit.
- 1 Hammer of Purphoros	+ 1 Kuldotha Forgemaster // 

Other cards to consider
